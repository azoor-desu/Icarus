Playing around with experimental ideas to make a music player that is able to sync music files and playlists across multiple devices without having Big Company telling you "no u can't do that".

Have multiple devices that you listen to music with?
Hate managing your playlists across devices?
Some songs you like not on Spoitfy so you can't sync the song to your phone?
Don't wanna let Spotify track your data?
Nothing seems to be able to sync your local song files easily?
This fancy new music player will solve all those problems! (When it's done).

Features:
- Uses a mapped network drive in Windows to act as a "file host" server
- Only on Windows.
- Music player is half-assed.
- Sync is not working properly. (yet)
- Help me syncing files is so hard what the heck.

TODO:
- Utilize popular cloud services for storing data (Dropbox, GDrive)
- Have the music player actually working instead of just the sync program
- Android version!
- Implement SQLite to replace database storage
