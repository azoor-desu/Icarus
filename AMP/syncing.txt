SyncChange: A generated list of changes for local/server. Obtained via comparing Exisitng files vs its corresponding .sync
.sync: Existing database for local/server that stores sync info for every file to sync.

Part 1: Scanning for changes. (Getting SyncChange)
1. Loop thru FOLDER songs and compare them to a List/Dict (from the .sync file) using PATHS.
Check Matched items for Date Modified, and if true, add them to the SyncChange list. (MetaChange)
Save each of the leftovers into another list each (FolderLeftover and .syncLeftover).

2. Loop thru FolderLeftover and compare them to .syncLeftover using uniqueIDs.
Matched items are Renamed. Check Matched items for Date Modified, and if true, add them to the SyncChange list. (Rename, or MetaChange + Rename)
Save each of the leftovers into another list each (FolderLeftoverLeftover and .syncLeftoverLeftover).

3. Finally, add the LeftoverLeftover lists into the SyncChange list. Files in FolderLeftoverLeftover are ADDED, while .syncLeftoverLeftover are DELETED.

4. Update the .sync file with the changes, so that it currently matches what is on the Local Disk.

SyncChange
IF a file has changes:
- MetaChange
- Rename
- MetaChange + Rename
- Added
- Deleted

Part 2: Comparing SyncChange
Compare the SyncChanges between Local and Server. If there are changes to the same file on Server and Local:
1. Overrides: Local Add > Server Add.
2. 
===========WIP IN THIS PART BELOW=========================
Scan the Local SyncChange against server's .sync to verify its logic.

If there is a local "ADD" for an existing file on the Server, check date modified. If local date modified is more recent, OVERWRITE server. Else, do nothing.
If there is a "DELETE" for non-existing files, do nothing.
If there is a "METACHANGE", check Date Modified on both sides. If Local file is more recent, push. If Local file is same or less recent, do nothing.

Scan the Server SyncChange against local .sync to verify its logic.

If there is a server "ADD" for an existing file on local, check date modified. If server date modified is more recent, OVERWRITE local. Else, do nothing.
If there is a "DELETE" for non-existing files, do nothing.
If there is a "METACHANGE", check Date Modified on both sides. If Server file is more recent, push. If Local file is same or less recent, do nothing.


need to iron out how to use SyncChange.
